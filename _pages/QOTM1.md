# You have received a quiz? What gives?

### Quiz of the Month is an experiment in the delivery of *delightful facts* and *factual delights*.

**Tired:** websites full of easily-clicked viral content that you crave.

**Wired:** unsolicited quizzes that encourage you to enjoy the thrill of discovery yourself.

Do quizzes stress you out? Dang, sorry! I blame school. Here's a hint for answering every question on every quiz:

<span class="spoiler">Type the question into google verbatim. That should do ya.</span>

### But I don't have time for a dang quiz!

That's cool. Use it for a paper airplane. This is a take-home, no-time-limit, no-grades quiz. Just wait a month and all the answers will be posted here, on Bao.
