A completely un-comprehensive, un-ordered list of mailing lists that I've been enjoying lately.

## [Department of Enthusaism](https://buttondown.email/jezburrows) 

Absolutely lovely, tremendous little snack of enthusiasm about things to listen to, read, or otherwise enjoy.

## [Art Snack](https://artsnack.substack.com/) 

Speaking of snacks, [Suzette Smith](https://twitter.com/suzettesmith) has been writing a regular, delightful, and informative newsletter on the arts in Portland. Since context has fully collapsed and locality means nothing, you can enjoy this from anywhere!


## [Tedium](https://tedium.co/) 

Hella nerdy internet / tech history list, but also hella charming. A few steps nerdier than Reply All, but always manages to make the subject matter interesting.

## [The Prepared](https://theprepared.org/newsletter): 

Totally not a prepper list! It's about tools and the challenges of physical manufacturing.

## [Run it Back](https://runitback.substack.com/)

Really well-researched and written newsletter about neglected Black history by Victo Luckerson.

## [Nightlife](https://nightlife.substack.com/) 

Colorful, long, often-intense newsletter from arts writer [Rahel Aima](https://twitter.com/cnqmdi) that seems to be dormant, but worth watching in case it comes back!
