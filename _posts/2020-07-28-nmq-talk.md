Nathaniel Mary Quinn is one of my favorite living artists, and the more I hear him speak the more I like him just as a person. [continues >]({{page.url}})

Episode 2 of my podcast, when I really do actually do it, will be about him. I've been thinking about his work a lot lately, spurred by how often people have described quarantimes as "surreal." It's actually because I don't think it's technically correct to label his work as "surreal" that it came to mind. The space between the art-historical meaning of the term and the popular usage of it is an interesting space to look into. 

Definitely worth some time checking out his work. Click below!
