So I love this little thing. Every other container on this earth that you can put wood glue in will eventually clog. Not Babebot. That's nice enough. But it's also called BabeBot. Why? Because it is the smaller version of the Gluebot. And, rather than calling it something like "Baby Glue Bot" or "Glue Babe", they went with _BabeBot_. Which I love.


Youtube Channel Enduringcharm has this to say about the Gluebot:

> This little glue bottle dispenser made by Fastcap has turned out to be a pretty big deal in my shop.  It makes it much easier to do glue ups when time is critical, and it allows application of the glue at all angles.
