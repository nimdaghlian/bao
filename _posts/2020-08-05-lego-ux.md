> At a glance, the variety of these designs can be overwhelming, but itâ€™s clear that some of these interfaces look far more chaotic than others.

A small cluster of very organised switch panels lies to the far right. The centre bottom is occupied by some wild concepts that are hard to understand, even after several glances.
