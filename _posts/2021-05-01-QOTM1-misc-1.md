### Answer:  [The designer of this restaurant's outdoor seating space](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-am-the-designer-of-this-restaurants-outdoor-seating-space-and-this-is-my-artists-statement)

"My work seeks to interrogate the parameters by which we define and demarcate physical space, exploring the fertile liminal zone between the falsely binary notions of “indoors” and “outdoors” we too often take for granted."
